# Request Header Parser Microservice

A simple microservice that parses the request header and sends back a JSON object with ipaddress, language and software keys.

This project is my solution for APIs and Microservices Projects - Request Header Parser Microservice and it's a part of APIs and Microservices Certification by freeCodeCamp.

Requirements
✅ A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your IP address in the ipaddress key.

✅ A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your preferred language in the language key.

✅ A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your software in the software key.

This is the boilerplate for the Request Header Parser Microservice project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice
